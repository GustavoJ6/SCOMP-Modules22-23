a) The output order may vary each time we ran the code, though it will always be printed:
1. x = 2;
2. x = 0;
Meaning that when the code is being executed in the parent proccess, it will be printed the 1st option and when the
code is being executed in the child's proccess it will be printed the 2nd..

b)
No, we have no way to guarantee that since that after the fork() we can't be sure which proccess will run the print
first.
