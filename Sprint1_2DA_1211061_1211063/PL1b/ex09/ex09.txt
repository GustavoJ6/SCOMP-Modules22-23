b) As expected, the program was terminated as it recieved the SIGINT signal by performing the 
CTRL-C action. The output message was:
make: *** [Makefile:14: r] Interrupt

d) The process was terminated. It recieved the signal SIGQUIT because of the performed CTRL-\
action. The output message was:
make: *** [Makefile:14: r] Quit

f) The process didn't stopped. It responded with the sigint handler: "I won’t let the process end with CTRL-C!"

g) The process didn't stopped. It responded with the sigquit handler: "I won’t let the process end with CTRL-\!"

h) The %1 is the index reference to the job that we are killing, let's say there are 6 jobs 
stopped, if i want to kill the 5th I would do a kill %5.
